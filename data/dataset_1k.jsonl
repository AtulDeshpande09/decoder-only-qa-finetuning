{"question": "Describe the purpose of model cards and datasheets for datasets.", "answer": "Model cards document model performance, limitations, and intended use; datasheets describe dataset composition, collection, and caveats, promoting transparency and responsible use."}
{"question": "Explain the purpose of database views.", "answer": "Views are virtual tables based on query results, providing abstraction, security by limiting data exposure, and simplified complex queries."}
{"question": "Explain the concept of 'closure' in JavaScript.", "answer": "A closure is a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them."}
{"question": "Explain event delegation in JavaScript.", "answer": "Event delegation refers to the practice of using a single event listener to manage all events of a specific type for child elements."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of a runbook in operations?", "answer": "Runbooks document procedures for handling incidents, deployments, or maintenance, ensuring consistent and efficient operational responses."}
{"question": "How does ERC-721 differ from ERC-1155?", "answer": "ERC-721 is for unique non-fungible tokens; ERC-1155 supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens in one contract."}
{"question": "What is database denormalization, and when is it appropriate?", "answer": "Denormalization introduces redundancy for performance, useful in read-heavy scenarios at the expense of storage and complexity."}
{"question": "What is a Governance Token?", "answer": "Tokens that grant holders voting rights on decisions regarding the protocol or project's future."}
{"question": "Explain the concept of responsive web design.", "answer": "Responsive design ensures web content functions across different devices and screen sizes, using CSS media queries and flexible layouts."}
{"question": "Explain Clean Architecture layers.", "answer": "Clean Architecture separates software into layers (Entities, Use Cases, Interface Adapters, Frameworks) for independence."}
{"question": "Design a distributed key-value store.", "answer": "Focus on data partitioning, replication for fault tolerance, consistency models, and handling node failures."}
{"question": "How does Transfer Learning reduce data requirements?", "answer": "It leverages pre-trained models on large datasets, requiring less data to adapt to specific tasks."}
{"question": "What is Cosign in container security?", "answer": "Cosign is a tool for signing and verifying container images and other artifacts within the Sigstore ecosystem."}
{"question": "How do you prevent CSRF attacks?", "answer": "Use anti-CSRF tokens, ensure SameSite cookie attributes, and verify origin headers."}
{"question": "What are gRPC streaming types?", "answer": "gRPC supports unary, server streaming, client streaming, and bidirectional streaming for flexible communication."}
{"question": "How does Indexing affect Write Performance?", "answer": "Indexing improves read performance but can slow down write operations because the index must be updated on every write."}
{"question": "What is the Curse of Dimensionality in ML?", "answer": "It refers to phenomena that arise when analyzing data in high-dimensional spaces, often making data sparse and algorithms inefficient."}
{"question": "What is the difference between Proxymock and Stub in testing?", "answer": "A Proxy controls access to an object, while a Mock verifies interactions and a Stub provides canned answers during testing."}
{"question": "What is Prometheus Scraping vs Pushing?", "answer": "Scraping pulls metrics from targets; Pushing allows targets to send metrics to a gateway for batch jobs."}
{"question": "What is a pull request (PR), and how does it work?", "answer": "A PR is a request to merge code from one branch to another, facilitating code review and discussion before integration."}
{"question": "Describe Semantic Versioning rules.", "answer": "SemVer uses MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH to indicate breaking changes, new features, and bug fixes respectively."}
{"question": "What is the primary benefit of Dependency Injection?", "answer": "It decouples classes from their dependencies, making code more modular, testable, and easier to maintain."}
{"question": "Compare JIT and AOT Compilation.", "answer": "JIT compiles code at runtime for optimization; AOT compiles before execution for faster startup and predictable performance."}
{"question": "What is the role of a Middleware in Express.js?", "answer": "Middleware functions have access to the request and response objects, executing code and calling the next middleware."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of Interrupt Vectors?", "answer": "Interrupt vectors are memory addresses pointing to interrupt service routines (ISRs) for specific hardware events."}
{"question": "When is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used?", "answer": "CNNs are used for processing grid-like data, such as images, due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies."}
{"question": "Explain the concept of security control automation testing performance metrics.", "answer": "Metrics measure the efficiency and effectiveness of automated tests (e.g., execution time, defect detection rate), optimizing test suite maintenance and value."}
